## 📄 Using `touch` and `vi` in Linux

### ✅ What `touch` Does:

`touch filename` creates an **empty file** if it doesn't exist, or updates the timestamp if it does.

### 📌 Example:

```bash
touch Dockerfile
```

This creates an empty file named `Dockerfile`.

### ✍️ Then Open It in `vi`:

```bash
vi Dockerfile
```

This opens the file for editing. You can now press `i` to insert text, then use `:wq` to save and exit.

### 🔄 Summary Workflow:

```bash
touch myfile.txt      # Create empty file
vi myfile.txt         # Edit file with vi
```

## 🐱 `cat` Command

### ✅ 1. Display File Content

```bash
cat filename
```

**Example:**

```bash
cat Dockerfile
```

🔹 This will print the contents of `Dockerfile` to the terminal.

### ✍️ 2. Create a New File with `cat`

```bash
cat > newfile.txt
```

Type your content, then press:

```
Ctrl + D
```

to save and exit.

> ⚠️ This **overwrites** the file if it already exists.

### ➕ 3. Append to a File

```bash
cat >> existingfile.txt
```

Type content, then press:

```
Ctrl + D
```

### 📚 4. View Multiple Files Together

```bash
cat file1.txt file2.txt
```

Displays both files' content one after another.

### 🔢 5. Show Line Numbers

```bash
cat -n filename
```

**Example:**

```bash
cat -n Dockerfile
```

### 📂 Bonus: Save Output to Another File

```bash
cat file1.txt > copy.txt
```

This **copies** contents from `file1.txt` into `copy.txt`.

### 🚀 Example Workflow

```bash
touch hello.sh
vi hello.sh   # Add: echo "Hello World"
cat hello.sh  # Displays: echo "Hello World"
```
